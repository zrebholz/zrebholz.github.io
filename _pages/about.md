I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Biology at Indiana University Bloomington. I currently work in the lab of [Dr. Kathy Darragh](https://kathydarragh.com/), Assistant Professor of Biology at IU Bloomington. 

I am originally from Reading, Pennsylvania. I obtained my B.S. in Biology at West Chester University in 2018. I completed my Ph.D. in Biology under the mentorship of [Dr. Dorothea Tholl](https://chemicalcommunications.wordpress.com/) at Virginia Tech (2024), where I researched the evolution and enzymatic basis of terpene pheromone biosynthesis in multiple lineages of insects, including stink bugs, lady beetles, and the Blattodea (termites and cockroaches).

I am broadly interested in how novel chemical phenotypes evolve in organisms at the genetic and biosynthetic levels 
-
- How are genes that are normally involved in essential functions coopted for novel, specialized biosynthesis? 

- How did the complex systems of chemical observed in animals (such as different chemical classes of pheromones of insects) evolve at the genetic level from an essential metabolic "tool box"?

- How and why do organisms separated by eons of evolution (such as plants and animals) synthesize identical chemical compounds for use in ecological interactions? 

To answer these questions and more, I work on gene discovery characterizing the enzymes and pathways that organisms use to generate chemicals mediating ecological interactions, such as communication and defense. In addition, I am interested in the mechanisms and drivers underlying macroevolutionary trends in the biosynthetic innovations and chemical diversity found in nature. 

Currently, my research at IU in the Darragh lab centers around the convergent/repeated evolution of the enzymes in pheromone and defensive biosynthetic pathways in a number of insect lineages, in particular the terpene compounds found in many butterfly and social hymenopteran (e.g., ants and bees) species.
