I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Biology at Indiana University Bloomington. I currently work in the lab of [Dr. Kathy Darragh](https://kathydarragh.com/), Assistant Professor of Biology at IU Bloomington.

I am broadly interested in how novel chemical phenotypes evolve in organisms at the genetic and biosynthetic level -- How are genes that are normally involved in essential functions coopted for novel, specialized biosynthesis? How did the complex systems of chemical signaling observed in the animal kingdom (such as the pheromones of insects) evolve from a common, ancestral genetic "tool box" shared by all life to the generate diverse biochemical innovations found in certain lineages? How do organisms separated by millions of years of evolution (such as plants and animals) independently evolve to synthesize identical chemical compounds used in ecological interactions?

To answer these questions, I am interested in uncovering the enzymes and pathways that organisms use to generate chemicals mediating ecological interactions, such as communication and defense. In addition, I am interested in the mechanisms and drivers underlying macroevolutionary trends in the biosynthetic innovations and chemical diversity found in nature. Currently, my research centers around the convergent/repeated evolution of the enzymes in pheromone and defensive biosynthetic pathways in a number of insect lineages, in particular the terpene compounds found in many butterfly and social hymenopteran (e.g., ants and bees) species. 

I am originally from Reading, Pennsylvania. I obtained my B.S. in Biology at West Chester University in 2018. I completed my Ph.D. in Biology under the mentorship of [Dr. Dorothea Tholl](https://chemicalcommunications.wordpress.com/) at Virginia Tech (2024), where I researched the evolution and enzymatic basis of terpene pheromone biosynthesis in multiple lineages of insects, including stink bugs, lady beetles, and the Blattodea (termites and cockroaches).
