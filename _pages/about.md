I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Biology at Indiana University Bloomington. I currently work in the lab of [Dr. Kathy Darragh](https://kathydarragh.com/), Assistant Professor of Biology at IU Bloomington. 

Currently, my research centers around the convergent and repeated evolution of the enzymes and biosynthetic pathways behind terpene pheromone production in a number of insect lineages, in particular butterflies and social Hymenoptera (e.g., ants and bees). I am broadly interested in uncovering the enzymes and pathways that organisms use to generate chemicals used in ecological interactions, such as communication and defense, and understanding the evolutionary mechanisms and drivers underlying biosynthetic innovations.

I am originally from Reading, Pennsylvania, a small city in southeastern PA, part of the greater Philadelphia metro area. I obtained my B.S. in Biology at West Chester University in 2018. I completed my Ph.D. in Biology under the mentorship of [Dr. Dorothea Tholl](https://chemicalcommunications.wordpress.com/) at Virginia Tech (2024), where I researched the evolution and enzymatic mechanisms of terpene pheromone biosynthesis in multiple species of insects.
